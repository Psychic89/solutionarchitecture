      Hands on cloud architect with experience in system transformation and design of fault tolerant, highly scalable and highly available applications. I am extremely passionate about Cloud computing and its future. 
                          
      Quick adaptability to new technologies and experienced in multiple technology platforms- AWS, DevOps/Agile, Microservices, Infrastructure automation
                          
      When not dabbling in cutting edge technology, I could be found experimenting with my 3D printer and casting CAD designs.
